INSTALLING HTMLHOUSE
--------------------

1. Extract the archive.
2. Run keys.sh to generate keys. This will generate a keypair in the
   application's directory named `prod` and `prod.pub`.
   BACK UP THESE FILES outside the application directory. If these change, 
   users won't be able to edit their posts anymore.
3. Run the application. Here's an example script:

   export DB_USER=dbuser
   export DB_PASSWORD=pass
   export DB_DB=htmlhouse
   export PRIVATE_KEY=keys/prod
   export PUBLIC_KEY=keys/prod.pub
   export PORT=8080
   ./htmlhouse -h="http://localhost:8080"
